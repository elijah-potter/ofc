# Ollama Function Caller

The Ollama function caller, otherwise known as `ofc`, is a command-line tool for prompting Ollama models locally on your system.

In order to use `ofc`, you need to have Ollama on your system. You may install it from the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/).

`ofc` was inspired by [`ooo`](https://github.com/Npahlfer/ooo).
